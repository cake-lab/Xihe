# Xihe: A 3D Vision-based Lighting Estimation Framework for Mobile Augmented Reality

This repo contains all the source code for the Xihe project.

## Directory Structure

- `server`: contains server-side code and relevant information for reproducing the server-side experimental results.
- `reference-app`: contains an Unity3D-based application. This application was developed using Xihe client/server APIs, and can be used for reproducing the remaining experimental results.
- `data`: contains two types of data. The `data/dataset` directory includes three necessary test datasets, while the `data/recording` directory consists of three AR session recordings for the lab-based real world tests. Note, the `data/dataset` directory is roughly **6.2GB**.

We provide detailed instructions for reproducing results in `README.md` files in both the `server` and `reference-app` directories.
